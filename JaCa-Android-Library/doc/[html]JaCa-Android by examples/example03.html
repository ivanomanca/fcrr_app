<h2>Example 03 - Reading the battery status</strong>
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this example we will show how to retrieve information related to the device battery in <strong>JaCa-Android</strong>. You can find the source code of this sample in the folder <strong>/jaca/android/tests/battery</strong> placed inside the main <strong>tests</strong> folder. The agent used in this sample joins the <strong>MiddlewareServices</strong> workspace for working with the <strong>BatteryArtifact</strong> artifact, an artifact provided by the middleware that allows to retrieve information about the device's battery. 


public class BatteryArtifact extends BroadcastReceiverArtifact {
	
  ...
	
  protected void init(boolean abortBroadcast) {
    super.init();
    defineObsProperty(HEALT, HEALT_GOOD);
    defineObsProperty(STATUS, "ok");
    defineObsProperty(LEVEL, 100);
    IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter();
    filter.addAction(BATTERY_CHANGED);
    IntentFilter filter2 = new IntentFilter();
    filter.addAction(BATTERY_LOW);
    IntentFilter filter3 = new IntentFilter();
    filter3.addAction(BATTERY_OK);
    linkBroadcastReceiverToOp(filter, "batteryInfoReceived", abortBroadcast);
    linkBroadcastReceiverToOp(filter2, "batteryLowReceived", abortBroadcast);

The <strong>BatteryArtifact</strong> is an artifact extending the \keyword{BroadcastReceiverArtifact</strong>, a <strong>JaCa-Android</strong> artifact that provides basic functionalities for registering an artifact as the target of Android broadcasts, in this case broadcasts concerning battery information updates. Roughly speaking the \keyword{BroadcastReceiverArtifact</strong> can be considered as the <strong>JaCa-Android</strong> version of the classical Android \keyword{BroadcastReceiver</strong>.


In BatteryArtifact</strong> is reported a source code snippet of the <strong>BatteryArtifact</strong> artifact.
%
<strong>BatteryArtifact</strong> highlights:
<ul>
%
<li> In the artifact initialisation we create the observable properties related to the battery level, status and health (namely the <strong>battery_level</strong>, the <strong>battery_status</strong> and the <strong>battery_health</strong>) and then we register the artifact to be notified by the broadcasts of interest for continuously retrieving updates related to the battery status.
%
<li> In the artifact disposal we call the <strong>unlinkBroadcastReceiverToOp</strong> method (inherited by the <strong>BroadcastReceiverArtifact</strong>) for unregister the artifact, during its disposal, as one of the target to be notified by battery broadcasts.
</ul>

<li> As soon as new battery information are available the <strong>BatteryArtifact</strong> generates proper signals that are handled by the agent with a set of reactive plans that prints in the console the new battery information.
