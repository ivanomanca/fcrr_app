@Article{LAMP-ARTICLE-2008-003,
   abstract    = {There is an impedance mismatch between message-passing
                 concurrency and virtual machines, such as the JVM. VMs
                 usually map their threads to heavyweight OS processes.
                 Without a lightweight process abstraction, users are
                 often forced to write parts of concurrent applications in
                 an event-driven style which obscures control flow, and
                 increases the burden on the programmer. In this paper we
                 show how thread-based and event-based programming can be
                 unified under a single actor abstraction. Using advanced
                 abstraction mechanisms of the Scala programming language,
                 we implement our approach on unmodified JVMs. Our
                 programming model integrates well with the threading
                 model of the underlying VM.},
